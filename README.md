# 🌐 Full Stack Learning Repository

This repository documents my complete journey through **Full Stack Web Development**, covering every layer of the stack — from foundational frontend concepts to advanced backend integrations. Each folder represents a distinct learning module, hands-on experiment, or mini-project.

---

## 🧭 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **HTML-CSS/** | Learn the fundamentals of HTML & CSS: structure, styling, layout, and responsive web design. Includes beginner-friendly projects and code snippets. |
| **JS-Learning/** | Explore JavaScript essentials including variables, functions, ES6 concepts, DOM manipulation, asynchronous operations, and APIs. Each subfolder demonstrates a focused topic or challenge. |
| **Git-and-Github/** | Practice version control using Git. Learn branching, commits, pull requests, conflict resolution, and repository management through practical exercises. |
| **Linux-WSL/** | A guide to working in the Linux environment using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Covers essential terminal commands, file navigation, and environment setup. |
| **Express.js/** | Learn backend development using Node.js and Express.js. Covers routing, middleware, authentication, error handling, environment variables, and RESTful APIs. Includes an `auth-project` demonstrating JWT and email verification. |
| **React/** | Dive into modern frontend development using React. Learn components, props, state management, hooks, event handling, and backend integration. Includes `frontend` and `backend` folders for full-stack practice. |
| **Projects/** | Contains mini-projects that combine frontend and backend knowledge. Example: `To-Do-App` — a CRUD-based task manager built using full-stack principles. |

## 💡 Learning Approach

This repository follows a **project-based learning** philosophy:
1. **Understand** — Learn each concept with simple examples.
2. **Apply** — Build small programs to test understanding.
3. **Integrate** — Connect multiple technologies together.
4. **Document** — Summarize every section with READMEs and comments.

## 📂 Recommended Learning Order

```text
Linux-WSL → HTML-CSS-Learning → JS-Learning → Git-and-Github → Express.js → React → Projects
```

This structure ensures a smooth, progressive learning curve — from frontend foundations to backend mastery and full-stack integration.
