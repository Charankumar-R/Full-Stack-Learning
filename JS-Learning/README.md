## Topics Covered

### Basics
1. **Variables**: Understanding variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`, including scope and hoisting.
2. **Data Types**: Exploring different data types in JavaScript such as strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null, and symbols.
3. **Operators**: Discussing various operators including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
4. **Control Flow**: Covering control flow statements like if-else, switch-case, and ternary operators.
5. **Arrays**: Explaining array creation, methods, and properties, including push, pop, shift, unshift, and iteration techniques.
6. **Objects**: Discussing object creation, properties, methods, and the difference between object literals and constructor functions.
7. **Functions**: Covering function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and the concept of first-class functions.

### Advanced
1. **Promises**: Understanding the concept of promises, how to create them, and methods like then, catch, and finally.
2. **Async/Await**: Covering async functions and the await keyword, including error handling with try-catch.
3. **Closures**: Discussing closures, how they work, and their use cases in JavaScript.
4. **This Keyword**: Explaining the context of the this keyword in different scenarios, including global, object, and function contexts.
5. **Prototypes**: Covering the prototype chain, inheritance, and how to add methods to objects via prototypes.
6. **Classes**: Discussing ES6 classes, constructors, inheritance, and static methods.
7. **Modules**: Explaining module creation and usage, including import and export statements.
8. **Error Handling**: Covering error handling techniques, including try-catch blocks and throwing errors.

### DOM Manipulation
1. **DOM Basics**: Introducing the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to access and manipulate DOM elements.
2. **Events**: Covering event handling, including adding event listeners and event propagation.
3. **Manipulation**: Discussing DOM manipulation techniques, including creating, updating, and deleting elements.

### Examples
- **JavaScript Tutorial**: Example code demonstrating various JavaScript concepts.
