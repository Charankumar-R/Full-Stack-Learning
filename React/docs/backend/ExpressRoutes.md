# Express routes explanation
# This document provides an overview of the Express routes used in the application.
# Express is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
# This document will cover the various routes defined in the application, including their purpose and how they are used.

## Introduction
Express routes are used to define the endpoints of your web application, specifying how the application should respond to client requests to particular URLs.

## Route Definitions
Route definitions in Express are used to specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), the URL path, and the function that should be executed when the route is accessed.

Example:
```javascript
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // code to retrieve and return users
});
```

## Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They are used to perform operations such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

Example:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received');
  next();
});
```

## Error Handling
Error handling middleware is used to handle any errors that occur during the processing of a request. It should be defined after all other app.use() and routes calls.

Example:
```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

## Conclusion
This document provided a high-level overview of Express routes, including how to define routes, use middleware, and handle errors. For more detailed information, please refer to the [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/).

# ExpressRoutes.md

## Express Routes

Express routes define endpoints for your backend API.

### Basic Theory
- Use `app.get`, `app.post`, etc. to handle HTTP requests

### Code Walkthrough
```
app.get('/api/items', (req, res) => {
  res.json([...]);
});
```

### Real-World Usage
- REST APIs, authentication, file uploads

### Advanced Techniques
- Route grouping, middleware chaining, error handling
