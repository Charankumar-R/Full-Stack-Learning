# Node.js setup explanation

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up Node.js for your project. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side and is perfect for building scalable network applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a computer with a supported version of Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- You have administrative privileges on your computer.
- You have a text editor or IDE of your choice installed (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text).

## Installing Node.js

1. **Download the Node.js installer** from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.

2. **Run the installer** and follow the prompts. The installer will guide you through the setup process, including accepting the license agreement, choosing the installation directory, and selecting components to install.

3. **Verify the installation** by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following command:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   This command will display the installed version of Node.js. If you see the version number, the installation was successful.

4. **Install npm (Node Package Manager)**, which is included with the Node.js installation. Verify the installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

   This command will display the installed version of npm.

## Setting Up a New Node.js Project

1. **Create a new directory** for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-nodejs-project
   cd my-nodejs-project
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project** using npm:

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter details about your project, such as the project name, version, description, entry point, test command, repository, keywords, author, and license. You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

3. **Install required packages** for your project using npm. For example, to install the Express framework, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This command will add Express to your project and update the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

## Running Your Node.js Application

To run your Node.js application, use the following command:

```bash
node <your-entry-file>.js
```

Replace `<your-entry-file>` with the name of your project's entry file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up Node.js on your machine and created a new Node.js project. You can now start building your application using JavaScript on the server side. For more information and advanced topics, refer to the [official Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
