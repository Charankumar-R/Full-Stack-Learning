# GraphQL explanation

# This file contains information and documentation about the GraphQL implementation
# in our project. It serves as a guide for developers to understand the schema,
# queries, mutations, and subscriptions available in our GraphQL API.
#
# GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries
# with your existing data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible
# alternative to the traditional REST API.
#
# In this document, you will find:
#
# - An overview of GraphQL and its benefits
# - The schema definition for our GraphQL API
# - Examples of queries and mutations
# - Information on how to subscribe to real-time updates
# - Best practices for using GraphQL in our project
#
# Please refer to this document whenever you need to understand or work with
# the GraphQL API in our project. It is essential to keep this document up-to-date
# as the API evolves and new features are added.

# 1. Introduction to GraphQL
#
# GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries
# with your existing data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible
# alternative to the traditional REST API.
#
# Some key benefits of GraphQL include:
#
# - Declarative data fetching: Clients can request exactly the data they need,
#   and nothing more. This reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
# - Strongly typed schema: The schema defines the types and structure of the data
#   that can be queried or mutated, providing a clear contract between the client
#   and the server.
# - Real-time updates: GraphQL supports subscriptions, allowing clients to receive
#   real-time updates when data changes.
# - Introspection: GraphQL APIs are self-documenting, and clients can query the
#   schema for available types, queries, and mutations.
#
# 2. GraphQL Schema
#
# The schema is the core of a GraphQL API, defining the types, queries, mutations,
# and subscriptions that are available. It is written in the Schema Definition Language
# (SDL) and serves as a contract between the client and the server.
#
# Here is an example of a simple schema:
#
# ```graphql
# type Query {
#   hello: String
# }
#
# type Mutation {
#   setHello(message: String): String
# }
# ```
#
# This schema defines a `Query` type with a single field `hello`, and a `Mutation`
# type with a single field `setHello`. The `hello` field returns a `String`, and
# the `setHello` field takes a `message` argument and returns a `String`.
#
# 3. Queries
#
# Queries are used to fetch data from the server. They are similar to GET requests
# in REST APIs. A query specifies the fields and types of data that the client
# needs, and the server responds with exactly that data.
#
# Here is an example of a query:
#
# ```graphql
# query {
#   hello
# }
# ```
#
# This query requests the `hello` field, and the server responds with the value
# of that field.
#
# 4. Mutations
#
# Mutations are used to modify data on the server. They are similar to POST, PUT,
# and DELETE requests in REST APIs. A mutation specifies the fields and types of
# data that the client wants to modify, and the server responds with the updated
# data.
#
# Here is an example of a mutation:
#
# ```graphql
# mutation {
#   setHello(message: "Hello, world!")
# }
# ```
#
# This mutation sets the `hello` field to "Hello, world!", and the server responds
# with the updated value of the field.
#
# 5. Subscriptions
#
# Subscriptions are used to receive real-time updates from the server. They are
# similar to WebSockets in REST APIs. A subscription specifies the events that the
# client wants to listen to, and the server sends updates when those events occur.
#
# Here is an example of a subscription:
#
# ```graphql
# subscription {
#   helloUpdated {
#     message
#   }
# }
# ```
#
# This subscription listens for updates to the `hello` field, and the server sends
# updates with the new value of the field.
#
# 6. Best Practices
#
# - Always specify the fields that you need in a query or mutation. This helps
#   to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
# - Use fragments to reuse common fields in queries and mutations.
# - Use variables for dynamic values in queries and mutations.
# - Use the `@include` and `@skip` directives to conditionally include or skip
#   fields in queries and mutations.
# - Use the `@deprecated` directive to mark fields or enums as deprecated in the
#   schema.
