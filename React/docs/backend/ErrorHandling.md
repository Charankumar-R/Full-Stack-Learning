# Error Handling explanation

This document provides an overview of the error handling mechanisms in our backend system. Proper error handling is crucial for maintaining the stability, security, and usability of the application. This document will cover the different types of errors that can occur, how they are logged, and the response sent to the client.

## Types of Errors

1. **Validation Errors**: These occur when the client sends invalid data. For example, a required field is missing or the data is not in the expected format.
2. **Authentication Errors**: These occur when a user fails to provide valid authentication credentials.
3. **Authorization Errors**: These occur when a user does not have permission to perform an action.
4. **Not Found Errors**: These occur when a requested resource does not exist.
5. **Server Errors**: These are unexpected errors that occur on the server.

## Error Logging

All errors are logged using our centralized logging system. This includes:

- The type of error
- A brief description of the error
- The time the error occurred
- The IP address of the client
- Any other relevant context

## Client Response

The client will receive a response containing:

- An error code
- A brief description of the error
- A suggestion for how to fix the error (if applicable)

## Best Practices

- Always validate client input.
- Use specific error codes for different types of errors.
- Never expose stack traces or internal server details to the client.
- Log all errors with sufficient context to diagnose the issue later.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our error handling is robust and helpful to both the developers and the users.
