# Environment Variables explanation
# This document provides an explanation of the environment variables used in this project.
# Environment variables are used to configure the behavior of the software without changing the code.
# They can be set in the operating system or in a configuration file, and are accessed in the code using
# the `getenv` function or similar methods.
#
# Common environment variables used in this project include:
#
# - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the database to connect to.
# - `API_KEY`: The API key for accessing external services.
# - `DEBUG`: A flag indicating whether to run the software in debug mode.
#
# Example:
#
# ```
# export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
# export API_KEY="myapikey"
# export DEBUG="true"
# ```
#
# These variables can be set in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or in a
# separate configuration file that is sourced by your shell.
#
# Note: Be careful not to expose sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, in your code
# or in publicly accessible configuration files.
