# Frontend-Backend integration explanation

This document provides an overview of how the frontend and backend of the application are integrated. It covers the communication protocols, data formats, and authentication mechanisms used in the integration.

## Communication Protocols

The frontend and backend communicate over HTTP/HTTPS using RESTful APIs. The frontend sends requests to the backend endpoints, which are defined in the backend application, and the backend responds with the requested data or confirmation of the action performed.

## Data Formats

Data is exchanged between the frontend and backend in JSON format. The frontend sends data to the backend as JSON objects in the body of the HTTP requests, and the backend responds with JSON-formatted data.

## Authentication Mechanism

Authentication between the frontend and backend is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The frontend includes the JWT in the Authorization header of the HTTP requests to authenticate itself to the backend.

## Error Handling

Errors that occur during the integration are communicated using standard HTTP status codes. The backend responds with appropriate status codes and error messages in the JSON format, which the frontend uses to display error notifications to the users.

## Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the integration between the frontend and backend of the application. For detailed information about the API endpoints and data structures used in the integration, please refer to the API documentation.
