# Basic HTML Overview

This section covers the fundamental concepts of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

## Purpose of HTML

HTML is used to structure content on the web. It allows you to create and organize sections, paragraphs, headings, links, images, and other elements that make up a webpage.

## Common HTML Tags

Here are some of the most commonly used HTML tags:

- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, and links.
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.: Heading tags used to define headings and subheadings.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.
- `<a>`: Creates hyperlinks to other pages or resources.
- `<img>`: Embeds images in the document.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Used for creating unordered and ordered lists.

## Best Practices for Writing Semantic HTML

- Use appropriate tags for their intended purpose (e.g., use `<header>` for headers, `<footer>` for footers).
- Ensure that your HTML is well-structured and easy to read.
- Use comments to explain sections of your code when necessary.
- Validate your HTML to ensure it meets web standards.

By understanding these basic concepts and best practices, you will be well on your way to creating well-structured and accessible web pages.
