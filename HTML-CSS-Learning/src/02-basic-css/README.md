## Introduction to CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout of multiple web pages all at once. It allows you to apply styles to web pages, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

## The Box Model
The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree. Each box consists of:
- **Content**: The actual content of the box, where text and images appear.
- **Padding**: The space between the content and the border, which is transparent.
- **Border**: A border that surrounds the padding (if any) and content.
- **Margin**: The space outside the border, which is also transparent.

Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and design.

## Selectors
CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. Common types of selectors include:
- **Element Selector**: Selects elements by their tag name (e.g., `p`, `h1`).
- **Class Selector**: Selects elements with a specific class (e.g., `.classname`).
- **ID Selector**: Selects a single element with a specific ID (e.g., `#idname`).
- **Attribute Selector**: Selects elements based on their attributes (e.g., `[type="text"]`).

## Specificity
Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules could apply to the same element. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used:
- Inline styles have the highest specificity.
- IDs are more specific than classes.
- Classes are more specific than element selectors.

Understanding specificity helps in managing styles effectively and avoiding conflicts.

## External Stylesheets
Using external stylesheets is a best practice in web development. It allows you to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making your code cleaner and easier to maintain. To link an external stylesheet to an HTML document, use the following `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

This approach enables you to apply the same styles across multiple pages, ensuring consistency throughout your website.
