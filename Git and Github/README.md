# Git and GitHub

## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)**. It helps developers:
- Track changes in their codebase over time
- Collaborate with others on the same project
- Manage multiple versions and branches of a project

**Key Features:**
- **Decentralized:** Every developer has a complete copy of the repository on their machine. No need for a central server.
- **History:** Easily view, revert, or compare changes made to files.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.

## Why Learn Git?

Git is a **must-have skill** for every developer. Even basic commands like `add`, `commit`, and `push` are essential for:
- Saving your work safely
- Sharing code with teammates
- Contributing to open source projects

## What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It provides:
- Remote storage for your code
- Collaboration tools (issues, pull requests, code reviews)
- Project management features

## Basic Git Workflow

1. **Initialize a repository:**  
   `git init`
2. **Check status:**  
   `git status`
3. **Add files to staging:**  
   `git add <filename>`
4. **Commit changes:**  
   `git commit -m "Your message"`
5. **Push to remote (GitHub):**  
   `git push origin main`
